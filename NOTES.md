# C++
- Change 'in danger' to return what kind of danger?
	- If multiple sources, return all of them?
	- Would make it easier to display why move can't be done
	- Would help teach the AI why the move can not be done

# AI
- Might be necessary to teach the AI what moves pieces can do
	- However, will it learn the limits of legit moves?
	- Would learning the limits hinder movement even when not in danger?
